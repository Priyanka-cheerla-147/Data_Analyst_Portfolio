## Portfolio Projects

In this section, I showcase some of my data analytics projects and describe the technology stack used to solve these real-world challenges.

**[Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Priyanka-cheerla-147/Sentimental_analysis/tree/main)**
This project utilizes Naive Bayes machine learning and regular expressions (RegEx) to classify hotel reviews as positive or negative. The model is trained on review text data, with extensive text preprocessing to remove irrelevant tokens. The Naive Bayes classifier calculates word probabilities to predict the sentiment of each review, and the results are stored in an output file.

Key Techniques: Naive Bayes Algorithm, RegEx, Text Preprocessing, Word Probability Calculation
Tools: Python, NumPy, TextBlob
This analysis automates sentiment classification, providing insights into customer satisfaction based on review text.

**[Airbnb Price Analysis using Tableau](https://github.com/Priyanka-cheerla-147/TABLEAU_Airbnb/blob/main/README.md)**
This project analyzes Airbnb rental prices across various factors such as the number of bedrooms, zip codes, and yearly revenue trends. The goal is to provide Airbnb hosts with data-driven insights to optimize their pricing strategies and identify high-revenue areas.

**Key Insights:**
Avg Price per Bedroom: Prices increase with the number of bedrooms.
Price per Zip Code: Identifies high-demand areas with higher rental prices.
Revenue Trends: Highlights seasonal fluctuations in rental income.
Tools: **Tableau ** for interactive visualizations, calculated fields, filters, and maps.

This analysis empowers hosts to make informed decisions regarding property pricing and maximize their rental revenue.
